        <div class="bodyContent">
            Law Anvil is a project made by Alyka Vidal wich lets you create universes and create their legal systems.
            Its completly done and mantained by just me but the project is public, you can acces it's code <a href="https://github.com/AlykaTR/lawanvildeploy">here</a>, feel free to do modifications to your own version if you want.
            Law Anvil can be a little bit complex, that's why we have done a wiki wich you can acces <a href="https://github.com/AlykaTR/lawanvildeploy/wiki">here</a>.
            I hope you have fun creating your own legal systems for your own univereses. Oh and we have a Discord server coming soon!

        <div class="center title">Why did I made Law Anvil</div>
        <div class="bodyContent">
            It's easy, I like technology and coding is the thing I like the most about it, but I have many other interests like:
            <ul>
                <li>Psychiatry</li>
                <li>Emergency and ICU medicine</li>
                <li><strong>Law</strong></li>
                <li>And all sciences in general!</li>
            </ul> <br>
            And this has 2 primary interest for me, <strong>law</strong> and <strong>coding (web development)</strong> but there is another thing to this:
            Law regulates most of my interests, it says how an ambulance should be equiped, it establishes what researchers can do and what don't and a ton of other interestings things!
            And that's why I decided to create Law Anvil.
