        <div class="bodyContent">Law Anvil is a project made by Alyka Vidal wich lets you create universes and create their legal systems.
                                 Its completly done and mantained by just me but the project is public, you can acces it's code <a href="https://github.com/AlykaTR/lawanvildeploy">here</a>, feel free to do modifications to your own version if you want.
                                 Law Anvil can be a little bit complex, that's why we have done a wiki wich you can acces <a href="https://github.com/AlykaTR/lawanvildeploy/wiki">here</a>.
                                 I hope you have fun creating your own legal systems for your own univereses. Oh and we have a Discord server coming soon!
